You earn points based on the length of the word submited and found in the game board. Words can be created from adjacent letters â€“ that is, letters which are horizontal or vertical neighbors of each other as well as diagonals. The letters must connect to each other in the proper sequence to spell the word correctly. This means that the next letter in the word can be above, below, left, or right of the previous letter in the word (excluding any letters previously used to construct the word). When a round is over, refresh your page to start a new game!   </p>
